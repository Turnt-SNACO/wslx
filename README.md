# wslx
A launcher application for running wsl with an xserver.

Currently limited to X410 ubuntu 18.04 with i3wm. This will not handle making config files for i3wm for you.  This also expects you have added 'export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0' to your bashrc.
WSLXSetup and WSLX should be run in the same directory.
